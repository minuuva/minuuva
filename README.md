### Hi there! My name is Minu Choi and I am an aspiring data scientist, currently studying at the University of Virginia. I have been learning Python, R, and SQL both in and outside of school work. Some of the collaborative work I have done were particularlrly enjoyable and I look forward to more opportunities. You can reach me at mminu0814@gmail.com. A fun fact about me: I am trilingual! I speak English and Korean at a native level and Spanish at a full business proficiency.
